# Shear Thinning from Bond Orientation in Model Unentangled Bottlebrush Polymer Melts

This repository contains LAMMPS codes used in our paper to simulate the non-equilibrium behaviour of bottlebrush polymer melts. 

You can read our paper [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.macromol.3c01061). 

To run the scripts, execute

```bash
lmp -in in.create_melt
lmp -in in.shear
```
